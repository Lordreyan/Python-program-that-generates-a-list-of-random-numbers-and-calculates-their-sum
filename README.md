1)The program uses the random module in Python, which provides functions for generating random numbers.

2)The generate_random_numbers() function takes an argument n which represents the number of random numbers to generate. In this example, we generate a list of n random numbers between 1 and 100 using the random.randint() function.

3)The calculate_sum() function takes a list of numbers as input and uses the built-in sum() function to calculate their sum. It returns the total sum as the output.

4)The program generates a list of 10 random numbers by calling generate_random_numbers(10) and stores it in the random_numbers variable.

5)The sum_of_numbers variable stores the sum of the random numbers, calculated by calling calculate_sum(random_numbers).

6)The program then prints both the list of random numbers and their sum using print() statements.

7)The output of the program will be different each time it is run since the numbers are randomly generated.

8)This program can be used as a starting point for further analysis or experimentation with random numbers. You can modify the code to suit your specific needs, such as generating a different range of numbers, generating a different number of random numbers, or performing additional calculations or analysis on the generated numbers.
 The random number generation is useful in used in simulations, games, statistical analysis, and cryptography. such as  Python's random module provides a range of functions and methods for generating random numbers, and this program demonstrates a simple implementation of random number generation and sum calculation.
